 * import `BUILD_INFO` rather than touching `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_*` directly.
 *
 * Values are inlined at build, so this is safe to import from client components.
 * The live deployment's identity (for update detection) comes from `/api/version`
 * at runtime; this module is the *baked-in* counterpart it gets compared against.
